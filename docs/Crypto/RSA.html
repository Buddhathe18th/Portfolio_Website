                        <p>Every single day, we use the internet to communicate and send information to people across the world. This could include a simple text asking what's for dinner, or it could be a highly confindential message sent between countries. All messages have an intended reciever, and when the message is intercepted, it could lead to a variety of troubles.</p>
                        <p>Here comes in cryptography, the study and process of hiding or encoding information so only the intended reciever can read it. It can start off simple, with a simple "Replace each letter with the next letter in the alphabet", but these simple ciphers can be easily broken</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">History</h2>
                        <p>The idea of RSA was first published in 1976 by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, but since there was not a deep understading of the difficulty of factoring, they did not fully understand the potential of RSA </p>
                        <p>Then, over the course of 1976, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman from MIT developed the idea of facatoring as a one-way function, and published the final form of this cryptosystem, and is named after the first initial of their last names, as appeared on their paper.</p>


                        <h2 class="section-heading">Prerequisite math</h2>
                        <p> </p>
                        <h3 class="post-heading">Factoring</h3>
                        <p>The basis of most cryptosystems are what's known as a <span class="bold">trapdoor function</span>. These are specific operations that can be easily computed in the forwards direction, but computationally expensive to reverse. RSA uses the difficulty of factoring large numbers as its trapdoor function.</p> 
                        <p>The most simple and common form of factoring any given number uses a prime-finding algorithm called <span class="bold">The Sieve of Eratosthenes</span>. The premise of this algorithm is that if a number \(n\) is not divisible by a prime \(p\), then \(kp \nmid n\) for all \(k\in \mathbb{N}\) </p>

                        <pre class="code">
import math

def sieve(n,factor):
    prime = [True for i in range(int(math.sqrt(n)+1))]
    i=2
    while i	&lt;int(math.sqrt(n)+1) and prime[i]:
        if n%i!=0:
            for j in range(int(math.sqrt(n)+1)//i):
                prime[i*j]=False
        else:
            if i in factor:
                factor[i]=factor[i]+1
            else:
                factor[i]=1
            return sieve(n//i,factor)
        i=i+1
    if n in factor:
        factor[n]=factor[n]+1
    else:
        factor[n]=1
    return factor</pre>

                        <p>A simple implementation of this algorithm is above, and as shown, it is recursive in finding a number's smallest factor, then factoring the remaining number will suffice. In addition, it only searches up to \(\sqrt{n}\) for maximum efficiency, and the algorithm returns when the given number is a prime.</p>
                        <p>When running this algorithm on small numbers, we see that if the numbers are similar size, the number of iterations are about the same. Now, let's try some bigger numbers. Let's try to factor \(91\)</p>
                        <p>We start at \(2\) and we check that \(2,3,5\) are not prime factors. Then we check \(7\) and notice that it does indeed divide \(91\). Then, our quotient is now \(13\), and assuming we do not know that this is a prime, we start at \(2\) and go until \(3\) to know that \(13\) is a prime. In total, this required \(6\) iterations.</p>
                        <p>Now, lets try to factor \(128\). We start by realizing that \(128\) is divisible by \(2\) so we divide to result in \(64\). Then, we repeat this process again 6 times to get that \(128=2^{7}\). In total, this used 7 iterations.</p>

                        <p>What we notice is that this algorithm is much more efficient in factoring numbers with a lot of small prime factors, opposed to a few large prime factors. This is a key in RSA, since RSA will have a public key that is a product of two large primes, which with this algorithm, is computationally exhaustive to factor.</p>

                        <p></p>
                        <h3 class="post-heading">Fermat's Little Theorom and Euler's Theorom</h3>

                        <p>In most forms of cryptography, math will be operated under a modulo, meaning all calculations will only be working with a number's remainder when divided by the modulo \(n\). For example, \(2+2=4\) but \(2+2\equiv 1 \mod(3)\) since the remainder of \(4\) when divided by \(3\) is \(1\). Now, an important few theoroms are <span class="bold">Fermat's Little Theorom and Euler's Theorom</span>. These two theoroms are the basis of solving RSA and its prerequisites</p>

                        <p><span class="bold">Fermat's Little Theorom</span></p>
                        <p> Let\(p\) be a prime, then for any integer \(a\), $$a^{p}\equiv a \mod (p)$$  </p>

                        <p>To prove this, let us use induction. Let \(p\) be a prime, and we want to prove for any integers \(a\) that \(a^{p}\equiv a \mod (p)\). To prove for all integers, we will split the set of integers into non-negative integers and negative integers.</p>
                        <p>First, we will prove this for non-negative integers. <br>Base case: \(a=0\): \(0^{p}\equiv 0 \mod (p)\)<br>Induction hypothesis: Let the statement be true for some positive integer \(a\). <br>Then \((a+1)^{p}\equiv \sum_{k=0}^{p}{p \choose k}\cdot a^{k}\)<br><br>Since \({p \choose k}\) for \(k\neq p\) has a multiple of \(p\) in the numerator, but not the denominator, this will always be divisible by \(p\). <br><br>So, \(\sum_{k=0}^{p}{p \choose k}\cdot a^{k} \equiv a^{p}+a^{0} \equiv a+1 \mod(p)\)</p>

                        <p>For any negative \(a\), since this equation is operated under modulo \(p\), \(a^{p}\equiv (a+kp)^{p}\) for any \(k \in \mathbb{N}\) such that \(a+kp\ge0\). Since we have already proved this for all non-negative integers, it must be true for the negative integers too.</p>
                        
                        <p><span class="bold">Euler's Theorom</span></p>
                        <p> Let \(n\) be a positive integer, then for any positive integer \(a\) such that \(\gcd(a,n)=1\), then $$a^{\phi (n)}\equiv 1 \mod (n)$$ where \(\phi (n)\) is equal to the number of positive integers \(k\) such that \(1\le k \le n, \gcd(n,k)=1\) </p>

                        <p>The proof of this is much more complicated compared to Fermat's Little Theorom, and far beyond the scope of this page, so its proof will be left as an exercise to the reader :D. One note is that \(\phi (p)=p-1\) for any prime \(p\). This shows how Euler's Theorom is a generalization of Fermat's Little Theorom. We also need to know that \(\phi (p\cdot q)=(p-1)\cdot (q-1)\) for primes \(p,q\)</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">RSA algorithm</h2>

                        <p>Imagine Alice was to recieve a message from Bob in the form of a positive integer, \(f\). To encode this, Alice finds two large primes, \(p,q\) and multiplies them into \(n\), also known as the public key.  She also chooses another number \(e\), which is generally chosen to be \(65537\). She takes \(n\) and \(e\) and distributes it to Bob, and any attackers who are trying to intercept this. Then Bob will take the plaintext \(f\), raise it to the power of \(e\), and then take the modulo \(n\). This will result in the ciphertext \(c\). Bob then sends this back to Alice. The equation of what just happened is $$c\equiv f^{e} \mod (n)$$</p>

                        <p>When Alice recieves this message, she can find the modular inverse of \(e\) in modulo \(\phi (n)\), and calls this \(d\) (We'll explain this later) and takes \(c\) to the power of \(d\) modulo \(n\). Miraculously, Alice is left with the value of \(f\).</p>

                        <p>Before we cover why that worked, and why it is secure, let's first try this out. Pretend you are Alice, and I am Bob. You generated two primes \(11,17\) and found the public key \(n=187\), and distributed that and \(e=3\) to me (For simplicity's sake, we aren't using \(e=65537\)). Remember, I don't know the two primes, and we are assuming I don't have the capabilities to factor it either. I now have a number \(f\), and I have sent back \(f^{3} \mod (187)\), which is equal to \(70\). Now, you will find \(d\), which is the modular inverse of \(e\) in modulo \(\phi (n)\) (If you have python, typing <span class="code">pow(e,-1,n)</span> will return the mod inverse). Taking the power of \(c\) to the power of \(d\) modulo \(n\) returns .... 93!!</p>

                        <p>How did that happen? Well, if we run through the steps one by one, we will see why this happens. We know that when Bob encrypted the plaintext \(f\) into \(c\), we have \(c\equiv f^{e} \mod (n)\). We know that \(f^{\phi (n)+1}\equiv f \mod (n)\) so we want to find a value \(d\) such that \(c^{d}\equiv f \mod (n)\Longrightarrow f^{ed}\equiv f \mod (n)\). So we want to find a value \(d\) such that \(ed\equiv 1 \mod (\phi n)\) since each time \(f\) is raised to the power of \(\phi (n)\) we return back to \(f\). This is why we found \(d\) as the modular inverse of \(e \mod (\phi (n))\). Therefore, \(c^{d}\equiv f^{ed} \equiv f^{k\phi (n)+1}\equiv 1\cdot f \equiv f \mod (n)\)<p>

                        <p>Imagine you have to store the grades of a class of 10 students. If you stored them in 10 double variables, how would you organize them? No worries, it's very simple with the help of <span class="bold">arrays</span>! Arrays are a class that is made of <span class="bold">consecutive memory locations that hold the same data type</span>. They are made of individual blocks called <span class="bold">elements</span>. Each element is not treated as its variable but as a part of the array. To access the elements, use the array’s name and the element’s index in the array. Arrays cannot have their size changed after being initialized.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">How to make an array</h2>
                        <p>Arrays are objects so like any other object, they are initially set to null and must be declared its type. If the array holds elements of type <i>Type</i> then the array object is type <i>Type[]</i>.</p>
                        <pre class="code">Type[] arrName = new Type[length];</pre>
                        <p>This statement creates an array called arrName that holds a length number of elements of type <i>Type</i>. If the length is left empty, then the array will be of length 0, also known as an <span class="bold">empty array</span>. If the elements are not given values, they will have their default value, so ints will be initialized as 0, Strings as null etc.</p>
                        <p>Arrays can also be initialized with an <span class="bold">array literal</span>. For example, in the code snippet below, we see the scores array of type double[] is being initialized with an array literal containing values 50.0, 60.5 and 99.9.</p>
                        <pre class="code">double[] scores = {50.0, 60.5, 99.9};</pre>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Indexes</h2>
                        <p>Indexes are the positions in the array. <span class="bold">Indices start from 0</span> so the first element in the array arr is referred to as arr[0] and the nth element is referred to as arr[n-1]. The index can only be from <span class="bold">0 to the array length minus 1</span>. To get the length of the array, use <span class="bold">arrName.length</span>. Note that length is an attribute, not a method.</p>
                        <p>Another way to traverse an array is the <span class="bold">for-each loop</span>. In a for-each loop, instead of the index that we increment, we look at each element in the array. The loop breaks when there are no more elements to look at in the array. This works exactly the same as a for loop, but this is easier to write.</p>
                        <pre class="code">
double[] scores={10.4, 30.3,5018.7};
//This does the same thing as
for (int i = 0; i &lt; scores.length;i++){
    System.out.println(scores[i]);
}

//This piece of code
for (double score:scores){
    System.out.println(score);
}</pre>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Why use Arrays?</h2>
                        <p>Imagine we have to save 100 scores from some students’ tests. Without arrays, we use the code on the left. It has 100 lines of just variables! On the right side, we use arrays of length 100 to store the scores of type double.</p>
                        <div style="display: table;width:100%;" >
                            <span class="col-5" style="display: table-cell; padding:1%">
                                <pre class="code">
double score1 = 50.0;
double score2 = 25.8;
double score3 = 95.2;

...//The rest of the 100 variables

double score100 = 89.22;
                                </pre>
                            </span>

                            <span class="col-5" style="display: table-cell;padding:1%">
                                <pre class="code">
double[] scores = new double[100];
for (double score:scores)
{
    //input a score
}


                                </pre>
                            </span>
                        </div>

                        <p>This is just with 100 students. Throughout the year, students have many tests, quizzes and assignments. If you had to put them all into individual variables, just imagine how long your program would be!

                        <h2 class="section-heading">2-d Arrays</h2>
                        <p>Two-dimensional arrays are <span class="bold">arrays of arrays</span>. Each element of the big array is another array holding more elements. They are considered two-dimensional because each element is defined by two indexes, one for which the index is in the big array and another for the index of the element in that element array. They are used to represent tables, matrices and planes.</p>
                        <p>This means if we had a 2-d array <i>arr</i>, then <i>arr[y]</i> is a one-dimensional array. <i>arr.length</i> is the length of the 2-d array, which is the number of rows it has. <i>arr[k].length</i> is the length of the row on the <i>kth</i> index. Similar to one-dimensional arrays, two-dimentional arrays can be initialized with the length or with an array literal</p>
                        <p>Two-dimensional arrays don’t have to be a rectangle! Ones that are not in a rectangular form are called <span class="bold">ragged arrays</span>. This means each <i>arr[k].length</i> may be different whereas rectangular ones all have the same <i>arr[k].length</i>.</p>
                        <p>A way to imitate 2-d arrays with only 1-d arrays is by using <span class="bold">parallel arrays</span>. This essentially acts like taking out the 1-d arrays from the 2-d arrays and using them separately.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Exception</h2>
                        <p>The most common type of expectation that can occur with arrays <span class="bold">isArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</span>. This occurs when the program is trying to get an element from the array, but the index isn’t in the array. For example, in the following code, we have an array with length 10, with all elements initialized. Then when we try to get the 5th element, we have no error, but when we try to get the 11 or -1 elements, it gives an <span class="bold">ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</span>.</p>

                        <pre class="code">
int[] nums = new int[10];
for (int i = 0;i &lt; nums.length;i++)
{
    nums[i] = i;
}

num1 = num[4]; //No error occur
num2 = num[10]; //ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException because index > 9
num3 = num[-1]; //ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException because index < 0
</pre>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Examples</h2>
                        <p>Using arrays, we used parallel arrays to list out the stats of different forms of  transportation, and then calculate who has the best form of transportation. The forms of transportation we use are buses, taxis, planes, trains and ferries and the things we consider are speed, price, range, wait time and capacity. Then we used these factors and calculated the best transportation. Then we rewrote the code to use 2d arrays instead of parallel arrays.</p>
